            I started building/drainage Construction since when I was 20 years old even before I got admitted into studying Quantity Surveying as a Course.
            since then till the age of 30, I have gained significant knowledge in construction both in bouilding and few other forms of construction including but not limited to, road, 
            structural steel, and so on. I have also advanced in the aspect of quantifying Construction works and supervising works and lots more.
